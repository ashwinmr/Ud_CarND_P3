    "#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",

    "I first tried implementing LeNet as-is but with 3 color layers for the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that my training accuracy was much higher than my validation accuracy\n",
    "which meant that I was overfitting the data. So I decided to reduce the features\n",
    "by converting images to grayscale. \n",

    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data so that it has mean zero and equal variance to improve learning\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model I reduced the batch size to 50 to improve accuracy\n",
    "I also increased the number of epochs to 12 to get more learning and higher accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 0.992\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 0.937\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 0.906\n",
    "\n",
    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* I first tried the LaNet architecture since I was familiar with it and it was used to solve a similar problem\n",
    "* The first problem I faced was that LaNet was made for grayscale images. I modified the placeholder to accept color images. This caused poor accuracy of my training and validation sets. This indicated that my model was underfitting.\n",
    "* I increased the complexity of the model by multiplying all output layers by 3 to compensate for the color images. This caused my training accuracy to become much higher than validation accuracy. This indicated that I was now overfitting my training set.\n",
    "* This is when I chose to convert the images to grayscale to reduce the number of features to learn and the idea that colors are not important to differentiate traffic signs. This improved my training and validation accuracy therefore my model was working well.\n",
    "* Finally I tuned the batch size and epochs to achieve the target accuracy. I reduced batch size and increased epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A convolution layer works well because the traffic sign can be at any position and small features need to be picked out first. Dropout would also help to make the detection more robust. \n",
